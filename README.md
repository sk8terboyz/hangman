# hangman

Programming Languages: Python

This is my recreation of the classic game Hangman. It is created using Python and the tkinter library that helps create the GUI.

This program is still unfinished. I am still unsure how I feel about the grid provided by tkinter. It makes it quite difficult to be able to freely design the GUI in a way that is pleasing to the eyes. I have also had issues trying to get the images implemented thanks to tkinter/Python, but I feel like that issue can be resolved by just using a different computer in a different directory where Python is reinstalled.
