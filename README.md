# hangman

Shane Kennedy

Programming Languages: Python

This is my recreation of the classic game Hangman. It is created using Python and the tkinter library that helps create the GUI. I have included an option to be able to play with multiple people (picking your own words) or play with a randomly selected word from a list of words. The words provided in the text document are the words chosen from. These words were found via a random word generator found online, so I did not create the list myself, it is completely random and more words can be added on in the future if needed.

This program is still unfinished. I am still unsure how I feel about the grid provided by tkinter. It makes it quite difficult to be able to freely design the GUI in a way that is pleasing to the eyes. I have also had issues trying to get the images implemented thanks to tkinter/Python, but I feel like that issue can be resolved by just using a different computer in a different directory where Python is reinstalled.
